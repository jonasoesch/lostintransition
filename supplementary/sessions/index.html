Both have shown that the mortality rate has dropped but in two different ways one showing that there are more older people and two that there are just less deaths per 100,000 period. The mortality rate also shows us that less people are being born because there are less deaths among young people or problems with birthing resulting in such a big drop in the mortality rates.

This is likely because a younger person is more likely to recover with the proper assistance. The 84+ range shows the lowest drop because at this age it may simply be someones time to go, regardless of the time period they're living in.

Especially for the older generation there would a expectation to be further decrease in mortality rate.  <br />Agree<br />Agree<br />Agree}</td>

      <td>{Y: Share of wind energy in total energy production, X: Year(s)<br />Since 2003 the share of wind energy has dramatically increased in certain states. The states with the most dramatic increases seem to share similar traits. For example Iowa, Kansas, Okalhoma, North Dakota etc. have seen the greatest increase in wind energy share. This could be due to the fact that these areas have relatively low populations and lots of open land suitable for wind farms/wind energy, where they would be harder to place in more populated areas. <br />There has been an increase in renewable energy, particularly wind, since the early 2000s. <br />Disagree<br />Disagree<br />Disagree}</td>

Geothermal power is virtually nonexistent in the U.S., and Solar has a long way to go. Unsurprisingly, coal has a noticeable decrease in total output, which is likely an effect of the push to be more environmentally conscious. Next to oil, coal is often the *face of pollution* in the public spotlight.<br />My overall conclusion is that the second chart is more legible. I find it clearer to understand the big picture.

Other states are taking some time to adapt, but there has been an extremely sharp increase in usage from 2009 onwards. California seems to have stagnated a bit after hitting its peak in 2013. <br />My overall conclusion is that while these 8 states have made good advances in wind energy production, there is still a long way to go. Wind only makes up 5% of the total U.S. power grid, which means other states are barely employing it. This could be due to a variety of factors, but it likely also has to do with the oil lobby's tight control of the industry that prevents states from adopting these new technologies.<br />Neither agree nor disagree<br />Neither agree nor disagree<br />Agree}</td>

The Y axis shows what percent of each total energy share is used in California.<br />The second chart shows that nuclear, oil, and coal energy are experiencing a sharp decrease in usage in California. Natural gas is slowly being diminished, along with heothermal's already small share of the energy pie. In contrast, wind, solar, and hydropower have experienced sharp increases in their usage in California. Biomass energy remains relatively unchanged.<br />My overall conclusion is that the second chart explains why wind energy was seemingly on the decline in California in the first chart. Around the same time as wind energy's plateau, solar and hydropower energy grew dramatically. This sharp increase in solar and hydropower output would cut into wind's share of the total energy output, thus explaining the previous small decline from 2009 onwards in wind production.<br />Neither agree nor disagree<br />Neither agree nor disagree<br />Agree}</td>

Natural gas spiked around the time gas prices were at their highest in the U.S., though this may be a mere coincidence.  The cost of oil is missing, as well as geothermal, hydropower, and biomass. Overall, the price of renewables is decreasing while nonrenewable resources are increasing.<br />My overall conclusion from the two charts is that the explosive growth of solar power from 2013 onwards in California directly correlates with prices reaching lower and lower barriers. As renewable forms of energy become more accessible to the general public, adoption will become more and more widespread. This could also be a side effect of environmental legislation that California is known for passing. The second chart also explains the sharp decrease in nuclear energy usage in 2012 onwards, as the price of nuclear energy around that time just about doubled.<br />Neither agree nor disagree<br />Neither agree nor disagree<br />Neither agree nor disagree}</td>

All groups seem to be less likely to have children, due to the percentage of the population under 25 continually shrinking, as well as the percentage of the population from 25-44.

The difference between deaths in Men and Women has decreased significantly. I would conclude that this is due to the fact that white collar jobs have been on the rise since the mid 90s, which correlates with the smaller gap. White collar jobs tend to be generally much safer than traditional jobs men would often work.<br />My overall conclusion from the two charts is that it they match pretty well together. Less deaths per 100,000 people indicates that people are living much longer than they used to, which explains the total amount of people over 75 in the first chart getting larger and larger as the years go by. This could also lend evidence as to why the other age ranges shrink, since those over 75 are not very likely to have children at that age.<br />Neither agree nor disagree<br />Agree<br />Agree}</td>

They are the only group that has experienced the most dramatic changes in total deaths, with 75-84 lagging not too far behind. The remaining age groups seem to steadily decrease in mortality rates, getting from one group to the next. It would be expected that this is the case, as medical advances mean people are able to detect problems earlier, and lead healthier lives.<br />My overall conclusion from the two charts on this page is that life expectancy in the U.S. has grown dramatically among men and women, as well as throughout all age groups. This can be the result of a variety of factors, but my best guesses are medical advances and safety guidelines that lend toward people living longer. There is still a fair amount of variation the life expectancy in those over the age of 84, but overall, one is more likely to see their elder years than ever before.<br />Neither agree nor disagree<br />Neither agree nor disagree<br />Neither agree nor disagree}</td>

The X axis shows the change in this percentage over time, from 1968 to 2010.<br />The second chart is a bit hard to read. If I'm understanding it correctly, I can conclude from the second chart that the age group 25-44 experienced a sharp decrease in deaths from 1995 onward after a rise beginning in 1983. The odds of someone under the age of 25 dying plummetted around 1980, 1993 and 2007. All groups have had lower mortality rates over the past few decades.<br />My overall conclusion from the two charts on this part is that you are much less likely to die now than ever before. The very elderly, those above 84 and from 75-84, still have a relatively high chance of mortality, being over 68% each year, but compared to previous eras, things are much better. Oddly enough the age range 25-44 is higher than the older ranges between 45-74. My best guess is that is more than likely due to homicide, suicide, or accidents. 25-44 is a range in which people tend to work the most, and have the highest chance of interacting with others, that could lead to an untimely early end one way or another.<br />Neither agree nor disagree<br />Neither agree nor disagree<br />Neither agree nor disagree}</td>

The X axis shows the total percentage of each type of cause of death between 1968 to 2010.<br />From the second chart I can conclude that I was right about my guesses on the previous page. Non-natural causes of death, such as homicide, accidents, and suicide, are very high compared to the likes of cancer and heart disease, which are the leading causes of death in the U.S. overall. The huge spike in deaths and ultimate decrease in the 1980s that ended around 1995 is around the height of the aids epidemic., which often goes hand in hand with drugs. Drugs can also explain the uptick in homicide and suicide, as well as accidents, and diseases of the liver, kidney, and pancreas, since they are all often correlated.<br />My overall conclusion from the two charts is that getting through 25-44 is one of the most difficult stages of life depending on what one's lifestyle is prone to. Natural causes of death seem to be pretty steady, but people within 25-44 should take extra precautions to not succumb to deaths that are not natural. The second chart shows just how much impact people 25-44 have on the rest of society that lie outside that age range. <br />Agree<br />Agree<br />Agree}</td>

While coal and nuclear have both slightly decreased in recent years, natural gas has increased. Alternative energy sources are beginning to see an increase in production. However, oil production remains unchanged. <br />My overall conclusion is that the US is clearly dependent on fossil fuels. The trends pointing a decrease in more potentially hazardous energy sources like nuclear and coal shows that we are willing to change, along with the increase in alternative energy sources. It's clear, however, with the amount of oil and natural gas production we maintain that the US needs to work harder to achieve clean energy production as a primary. <br />Strongly agree<br />Strongly agree<br />Strongly agree}</td>

They all started to increase in 2005 with a rapid increase showing between 2007 and 2009. Iowa and Kansas rely on wind for total energy production at nearly 40%, a percentage that increased significantly from their starting point at below 5%. California and Illinois, however, have not made it past 10%, despite the slow and steady increase. <br />I would conclude that the states represented on the second chart, primarily Iowa and Kansas, are significantly responsible for the US increase in wind production for energy in the last 7 years or so.

Solar power, for instance, was virtually unseen and has become one of the strongest percentages represented on the chart. Although California is not comparatively as strong as the other states with wind power, they have significantly decreased their use of coal and oil to almost zero and nuclear continues to lessen.  <br />I can conclude that California is dedicated to sourcing alternative energy sources and making them a primary source.

Solar power started off as the most expensive on the chart at 60 and has decreased rapidly to the second most affordable, only topped by wind. <br />I would conclude that as an energy source is used less, its price increases. Alternative energy sources, for instance, have seen a rapid increase and use and an even more rapid decrease in price, while sources not used as frequently, such as nuclear and coal, are becoming more expensive.

Respiratory disease is the least likely to affect this age group, along with AIDS (in the present day). <br />My overall conclusion for these two charts combined is that life expectancy is increasing. Because the second chart focuses on one age range and cause of death specifically, it's clear that science and medicine are helping people live longer, healthier lives.

This is probably in part due to terrorism and countries increasing nuclear production driving the cost up.<br />Natural gas is the source to beat. Wind and solar are a small percentage of usage, but the lowest cost.

I didn't realize that natural gas was almost consistently the number one most produced. <br />My overall conclusion from the two charts is that while Earth friendly power sources are growing, they pale in comparison to the energy sources that are destroying our planet.

They should be used as an example for the other states to follow. I can also conclude that of the top eight wind energy producing states, four of them are below 20% and two of those are below 10%. That is pretty sad to make it on a top eight list and still be under 10% of energy production from wind.<br />My overall conclusion from the two charts on this page is that while a few states are getting a significant amount of energy from wind production, half of the top eight are getting under 20% of their energy from wind. I drive through Wyoming 2-3 times per year, and it is always very windy there - to the point where it has ripped the bed cover completely off of my husband's truck.
